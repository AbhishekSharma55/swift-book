A Guided Tour of the Swift Language
===================================

Values
------

.. Print "Hello World"
.. Set variables and constants
.. Note on type inference
.. Perform simple math
.. Perform string interpolation

Control Flow
------------

.. Make decisions with "if" and "switch"
.. Repeat code with "while" and "for"

Functions
---------

.. Define functions with "func"
.. Call functions with "()" postfix.
.. [No discussion of selector style syntax here.]

Objects
-------

.. Declare classes with "class"
.. Declare methods with "func"
.. Declare properties with "var" and "let"
.. Make instances with "Class()"
.. Access methods and properties with "."
.. Customize object lifecycle with "init" and "deinit"

.. Indicate superclass and protocol conformance with ":"
.. Override superclass methods with "@override"
.. Call the superclass's implentation with "super"

Value Types
-----------

.. Differences from objects (reference types)
.. Use tuples for simple multipart data
.. Use structs for complex multipart data
.. Use enums when values come from a list
.. Associating additional data with enums
.. Indicate protocol conformance using ":"

Protocols
---------

.. Again, supported by both reference and value types
.. Distinguish is/has/can ...
.. Can be used as a first-class type (ie in variable declaration)

Optionals
---------

.. Contrast with nil/NULL
.. Implemented as enum (no magic)
.. Convenience syntax "?" and "!"

Generics
--------

Patterns and Advanced Switches
