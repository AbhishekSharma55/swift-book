Strings and characters
======================

.. docnote:: Strings and characters

	I've given string definition and manipulation its own chapter, as it's such a fundamental thing that developers do all the time, and we have a lot of flexibility to cover.

.. docnote:: Subjects to be covered in this section

	* String literals
	* Substrings and iteration
	* String encoding and Unicode support
	* String interpolation
	* printf() and string formatting
