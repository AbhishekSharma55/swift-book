Reference Manual
================

.. annotation:: Overview

	The Reference Manual will provide a complete reference to every aspect of the language and its standard library. Although it is a reference work, it is still intended for human (rather than machine) consumption, and will be written as such. It is intended as a reference work for programmers, not for compiler authors (for whom the language’s actual specification – not included in this book – is the primary work).


.. annotation:: Voice and style

	The Reference Manual’s prose style will be based around short, succinct statements of fact, rather than a flowing narrative. Its aim is brevity of definition, together with clarity and lack of ambiguity. It will be complete, and will include tables and reference charts where these are the best way to provide this completeness.
