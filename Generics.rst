Generics
========

.. docnote:: Generics

	I've given generics their own chapter, as the ability to define one's own generics (in addition to the library-provided ones) is such a powerful part of Swift. I've also included Delayed Identifier Resolution here, as it feels conceptually like part of Swift's ability to deal with types in a generic way.

.. docnote:: Subjects to be covered in this section

	* Vector
	* Array
	* Dictionary
	* (any other generics from the Standard Library)
	* Typing of generics
	* Working with subscripts
	* Creating generic functions, classes etc.
	* Delayed Identifier Resolution
