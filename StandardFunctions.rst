.. docnote:: Standard functions vs Standard Library

	I deliberately haven't referred to this as the ‘Standard Library’, for reasons mentioned previously. However, this does beg the question: are there enough standard functions to warrant a stand-alone (and potentially rather dry) chapter? Should some of these (find, swap, sort, map) be covered under Generics, and others (min, max) under Basic Types instead?
