This repository contains a version of “The Swift Programming Language” that can be built using Swift DocC.

The published version of “The Swift Programming Language” on docs.swift.org is currently built using a legacy toolchain.  Our goal is to replace it with a version built from this repository, working with the community to extend Swift DocC to make this possible.

# Contributions

For small changes, like typo fixes and changes to a few paragraphs, fork this repository and make a pull request.

For larger changes, start a pitch thread in the [Swift forums][forum] to discuss the approach and possible issues before you invest a lot of time writing.  Because changes in this repository must be manually ported back to the published version, we’re not ready to take many large changes.

# Building

◊FIXME: Describe how to run `docc` to make the thing.  Is it just `docc preview` and then open the output?
