# The Swift Programming Language

This repository contains a version of *The Swift Programming Language*
that you can build using Swift-DocC.

The version of *The Swift Programming Language* published on docs.swift.org
is currently built using a legacy toolchain,
not from this repository or its content.
The goal is to replace that version with a version built from this repository,
working with the community to extend Swift-DocC where needed.

## Building

If you have Xcode installed,
run `xcrun docc preview` in this repository.

If you have a Swift toolchain installed,
or if you installed [Swift-DocC](https://github.com/apple/swift-docc) directly,
run `docc preview` in this repository.

After running DocC,
open the link that `docc` outputs for the local preview.
