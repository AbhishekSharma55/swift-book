## Building

Run `docc preview TSPL.docc`
in this repository's root directory.

> If you see the error `command not found: docc`, consider adding `docc` to your shell's `$PATH`.
>
> In Swift toolchains downloaded from swift.org, `docc` is located at `/usr/bin/docc` relative to the installation path of the toolchain.
>
> If you have Xcode installed on `/Applications`, it will be `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/docc`. You can also use `xcrun docc` to help locate it.

After running DocC, open the link that `docc` outputs
to display a local preview in your browser.
