.. docnote:: Subjects to be covered in this section

    * Array
    * Dictionary
    * (any other generics from the Standard Library)
    * Typing of generics
    * Working with subscripts
    * Creating one's own generics

Generics
========

.. write-me::

Associated Types
----------------

.. write-me::

.. Associated typealiases
.. â€¦with default types
.. perhaps this should be pushed forward to Generics,
   as that's where it really comes in useful?

Self with a capital S
---------------------

.. write-me::

.. Self as the dynamic type of the current type

Operators
---------

.. write-me::

.. Protocols can require the implementation of operators (though assignment operators are broken)
.. Likewise for requiring custom operators
.. However, Doug thought that this might be better covered by Generics,
   where you know that two things are definitely of the same type.
   Perhaps mention it here, but don't actually show an example?
