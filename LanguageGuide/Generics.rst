.. docnote:: Subjects to be covered in this section

    * Array
    * Dictionary
    * (any other generics from the Standard Library)
    * Typing of generics
    * Working with subscripts
    * Creating one's own generics
    * Subscript getters and setters

.. NOTE: subscript is not really a Generics-specific subject,
   but I think it's more useful if we introduce it in this chapter
   rather than in the Classes and Structures chapter,
   as you're more likely to use it when working with your own generic types.

.. NOTE: you can subscript on any type, including a range (IntGeneratorType)
