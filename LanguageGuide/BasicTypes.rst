Basic Types
===========

Swift provides several basic types for working with fundamental values.
Some of these types will be familiar to C and Objective-C developers:

* :newTerm:`numbers` (including integers and floating-point numbers)
* :newTerm:`booleans` (for values that can only be true or false)
    
Although these types may be familiar,
Swift expands their capabilities beyond what is possible in other languages.

In addition to these simple types,
Swift introduces some less familiar (but very powerful) advanced types:

* arbitrary groups of values of different types (known as :newTerm:`tuples`)
* types that can be either a known value or a missing value (known as :newTerm:`optionals`)

Each of these types, and the ways in which they can be used,
are discussed in more detail below.

Swift also provides a powerful and flexible way to create and work with string and character types.
These are introduced below, and are discussed in more detail in :doc:`Strings`.

Named Values
------------

.. QUESTION: Do we need to have introduced the REPL
   (or some other learning environment) before starting this section?

A :newTerm:`named value` is a way to store a particular value
(such as the number ``42``, or the string ``"hello"``)
and refer to it via a specific name in your code.
Swift provides two types of named values:

* :newTerm:`constant named values`, also known as :newTerm:`constants`, and
* :newTerm:`variable named values`, also known as :newTerm:`variables`

A constant has a fixed value that cannot be changed once it is set,
whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.

All named values must be declared before they are used.
Constants are declared using the ``let`` keyword,
and variables are declared using the ``var`` keyword.
Here's an example of how constants and variables could be used
to track the number of login attempts a user has made:

.. testcode:: namedValues

    (swift) let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
    // maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts : Int = 10
    (swift) var currentLoginAttempt = 0
    // currentLoginAttempt : Int = 0

This can be read as:

‚ÄúDeclare a new constant called ``maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts``,
and give it an initial value of ``10``.
Then, declare a new variable called ``currentLoginAttempt``,
and give it an initial value of ``0``.‚Äù

A constant is used for the maximum number of allowed login attempts,
as this is a fixed maximum value that does not need to change.
A variable is used for the current login attempt counter, however,
as this value needs to be incremented after each failed login attempt.

If a named value in your code is not going to change,
it should always be declared as a constant with the ``let`` keyword.
Variables should only be used for
named values that need to be able to change their value.

Named value declarations can include a specific *type*,
to be explicit about the kind of named value you want to create:

.. testcode:: namedValues

    (swift) let welcomeMessage: String = "Hello"
    // welcomeMessage : String = "Hello"

The colon in the declaration means *‚Äú‚Ä¶that is a‚Ä¶‚Äù*,
so this can be read as:

‚ÄúDeclare a constant called ``welcomeMessage`` that is a ``String``,
and give it a value of ``"Hello"``.‚Äù

.. TODO: Update the rest of the Guide to use let
   wherever and whenever mutability is not required,
   and note that var is something you should really only opt in to
   when you know that the variable's value should be allowed to mutate.

You can use pretty much any character you like for constant and variable names,
including `Unicode <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode>`_ characters:

.. testcode:: namedValues

    (swift) let œÄ = 3.14159
    // œÄ : Double = 3.14159
    (swift) let ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
    // ‰Ω†Â•Ω : String = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
    (swift) let üê∂üêÆ = "dogcow"
    // üê∂üêÆ : String = "dogcow"

Constant and variable names cannot contain
mathematical symbols, arrows, private-use (or invalid) Unicode code points,
or line- and box-drawing characters.
They also cannot begin with a number
(although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name).
Once you've declared a named value,
you can't redeclare it again with the same name,
or change it from a constant to a variable (or vice versa).

The value of an existing variable can be changed to another value of the same type.
You can also print the value of any named value using the ``println`` function,
to see its current value:

.. testcode:: namedValues

    (swift) var friendlyWelcome = "hello, world"
    // friendlyWelcome : String = "hello, world"
    (swift) friendlyWelcome = "üëã, üåé"
    (swift) println(friendlyWelcome)
    >>> üëã, üåé

.. NOTE: this is a deliberately simplistic description of what you can do with println().
   It will be expanded later on.

Unlike a variable, the value of a constant cannot be changed once it is set,
and attempting to do so will result in an error:

.. testcode:: namedValues

    (swift) let languageName = "Swift"
    // languageName : String = "Swift"
    (swift) languageName = "Swift++"
    !!! <REPL Input>:1:14: error: cannot assign to 'let' value 'languageName'
    !!! languageName = "Swift++"
    !!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ^


Integers
--------

:newTerm:`Integers` are whole numbers with no fractional component,
such as ``42``, ``0`` and ``-23``.
Integers are either :newTerm:`signed` (which means they can be positive or negative),
or :newTerm:`unsigned` (which means they can only be positive).

Swift provides integers in signed and unsigned forms at
8, 16, 32 and 64-bit sizes.
These integers follow a similar naming convention to C,
in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is a ``UInt8``,
and a 32-bit signed integer is an ``Int32``.
Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names.

In most cases, there's no need to pick a specific size of integer to use in your code.
Swift provides an additional integer type, ``Int``,
which has the same size as the current platform's architecture:

* On a 32-bit platform, ``Int`` is the same size as ``Int32``
* On a 64-bit platform, ``Int`` is the same size as ``Int64``

Unless you need to work with a specific size of integer,
you should always use ``Int`` for code consistency and interoperability.
Even on 32-bit platforms, ``Int`` can store any value between ``-2,147,483,648`` and ``2,147,483,647``,
and is typically large enough for everyday integer values.

Floating-Point Numbers
----------------------

:newTerm:`Floating-point numbers` (also known as :newTerm:`floats`) are numbers with a fractional component,
such as ``3.14159``, ``0.1`` and ``-273.15``.

Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:

* ``Double``, which represents a 64-bit floating-point number,
  and should be used when floating-point values need to be very large or particularly precise
* ``Float``, which represents a 32-bit floating point number,
  and should be used when floating-point values do not require 64-bit precision

Type Safety and Type Inference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Swift is a :newTerm:`type-safe` language.
This means that it encourages you to be clear about the types of values and objects your code can work with.
If some part of your code expects a string, for example,
type safety means that you can't accidentally pass it an integer by mistake.

Because Swift is type safe,
it is able to perform :newTerm:`type checks` when compiling your code.
Any mismatched types are flagged as errors so that you can fix them.

Type-checking helps to avoid accidental errors when working with different types of value.
However, this doesn't mean that you have to define the type of
every constant and variable that you declare.
If you don't specify the type of value you need,
Swift will use :newTerm:`type inference` to work out the appropriate type.
Type inference is the ability for a compiler to automatically deduce the type of a particular expression when it compiles your code,
just by examining the values you provide.

Type inference is particularly useful
when you declare a constant or variable with an initial value.
This is often done by assigning a :newTerm:`literal value` (or :newTerm:`literal`)
to the constant or variable at the point that you declare it.
A literal value is a one-off value that appears directly in your source code,
such as ``42`` and ``3.14159`` in the examples below.

For example: if you assign a literal value of ``42`` to a new constant,
without saying what type it is,
Swift will deduce that you want the constant to be an ``Int``,
because you have initialized it with a number that looks like an integer:

.. testcode:: typeInference

    (swift) let meaningOfLife = 42
    // meaningOfLife : Int = 42

Likewise, if you don't specify a type for a floating-point literal,
Swift assumes that you want to create a ``Double``:

.. testcode:: typeInference

    (swift) let pi = 3.14159
    // pi : Double = 3.14159

Swift always chooses ``Double`` (rather than ``Float``)
when inferring the type of floating-point numbers.

If you combine integer and floating-point literals in an expression,
a type of ``Double`` will be inferred from the context:

.. testcode:: typeInference

    (swift) let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159
    // anotherPi : Double = 3.14159

The literal value of ``3`` does not have an explicit type in and of itself,
and so an appropriate output type of ``Double`` is inferred
from the presence of a floating-point literal as part of the addition.

Type inference means that Swift requires far fewer type declarations than languages such as C or Objective-C.
Named values are still explicitly-typed,
but much of the work of specifying their type is done for you.

Numeric Literals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer literals can be written as:

* a :newTerm:`decimal` number, with no prefix
* a :newTerm:`binary` number, with a ``0b`` prefix
* an :newTerm:`octal` number, with a ``0o`` prefix, or
* a :newTerm:`hexadecimal` number, with a ``0x`` prefix

All of these integer literals have a decimal value of ``17``:

.. testcode:: numberLiterals

    (swift) var decimalInteger = 17
    // decimalInteger : Int = 17
    (swift) var binaryInteger = 0b10001        // 17 in binary notation
    // binaryInteger : Int = 17
    (swift) var octalInteger = 0o21            // 17 in octal notation
    // octalInteger : Int = 17
    (swift) var hexadecimalInteger = 0x11      // 17 in hexadecimal notation
    // hexadecimalInteger : Int = 17

Floating-point literals can be decimal (with no prefix),
or hexadecimal (with a ``0x`` prefix).
The must always have a number (or hexadecimal number) on both sides of the decimal point.
They can also have an optional :newTerm:`exponent`,
indicated by an upper- or lower-case ``e`` for decimal floats,
or an upper- or lower-case ``p`` for hexadecimal floats.

For decimal numbers with an exponent of ``exp``,
the base number is multiplied by 10\ :superscript:`exp`:

* ``1.25e2`` means 1.25 ‚®â 10\ :superscript:`2`, or ``125.0``
* ``1.25e-2`` means 1.25 ‚®â 10\ :superscript:`-2`, or ``0.0125``

For hexadecimal numbers with an exponent of ``exp``,
the base number is multiplied by 2\ :superscript:`exp`:

* ``0xFp2`` means 15 ‚®â 2\ :superscript:`2`, or ``60.0``
* ``0xFp-2`` means 15 ‚®â 2\ :superscript:`-2`, or ``3.75``

All of these floating-point literals have a decimal value of ``12.5``:

.. testcode:: numberLiterals

    (swift) var decimalDouble = 12.5
    // decimalDouble : Double = 12.5
    (swift) var exponentDouble = 1.25e1
    // exponentDouble : Double = 12.5
    (swift) var hexadecimalDouble = 0xC.8p0
    // hexadecimalDouble : Double = 12.5

Numeric literals can contain extra formatting to make them easier to read.
Both integers and floats can be padded with extra zeroes on the beginning,
and can contain underscores to help with readability.
Neither type of formatting affects the underlying value of the literal:

.. testcode:: numberLiterals

    (swift) var paddedDouble = 000123.456
    // paddedDouble : Double = 123.456
    (swift) var oneMillion = 1_000_000
    // oneMillion : Int = 1000000
    (swift) var justOverOneMillion = 1_000_000.000_000_1
    // justOverOneMillion : Double = 1e+06

In the example above, the value of ``justOverOneMillion`` has been printed as ``1e+06``.
This is a short-form representation of its underlying ``Double`` value of ``1000000.0000001``.
The actual value of ``justOverOneMillion`` still has all of the precision of the original.

Numeric Type Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Int`` type should be used for all general-purpose integer named values in your code,
even if they are known to be non-negative.
Using the default integer type in everyday situations means that
integer named value are immediately interoperable in your code,
and will match the inferred type for integer literal values.

Other integer types should only be used when they are are specifically needed for the task at hand,
due to explicitly-sized data from an external source,
or for performance, memory usage, or other optimization.
Using explicitly-sized types in these situations
helps to catch any accidental value overflows,
and implicitly documents the nature of the data being used.

Integer Conversion
__________________

The range of numbers that can be stored in an integer named value
is different for each numeric type.
An ``Int8`` named value can store numbers between ``-128`` and ``127``,
whereas a ``UInt8`` named value can store numbers between ``0`` and ``255``.
A number that can be stored in one numeric type
cannot necessarily be stored in another numeric type.

Because of this, numeric type conversion is something you must opt in to on a case-by-case basis.
This avoids accidental errors, and helps to make type conversion intentions explicit in your code.

To convert from one specific number type to another,
you initialize a new number of the desired type with the existing value:

.. testcode:: typeConversion

    (swift) let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000
    // twoThousand : UInt16 = 2000
    (swift) let one: UInt8 = 1
    // one : UInt8 = 1
    (swift) let twoThousandAndOne = twoThousand + UInt16(one)
    // twoThousandAndOne : UInt16 = 2001

The constant ``twoThousand`` is a ``UInt16``,
whereas the constant ``one`` is a ``UInt8``.
They cannot be added together directly,
because they are not of the same type.
Instead, this code calls ``UInt16(one)`` to create a new ``UInt16`` initialized with the value of ``one``,
and uses this value in place of the original.
Because both sides of the addition are now of type ``UInt16``,
the addition is allowed.
The output constant (``twoThousandAndOne``) is inferred to be a ``UInt16``,
because it is the sum of two ``UInt16`` values.

The syntax seen above ‚Äì
``SomeType(ofInitialValue)`` ‚Äì
is the default way to call the initializer of a Swift type,
and to pass in an initial value.
Behind the scenes, ``UInt16`` has an initializer that accepts a ``UInt8`` value,
and so this initializer is used to make a new ``UInt16`` from an existing ``UInt8``.
You can't just pass in *any* type here, however ‚Äì
it has to be a type for which ``UInt16`` provides an initializer.
Extending existing types to accept new types
(including your own type definitions) as initializers
is covered in :doc:`ProtocolsAndExtensions`.

.. TODO: add a note that this is not traditional type-casting,
   and perhaps include a forward reference to the objects chapter.

Integer to Floating-Point Conversion
____________________________________

Conversions between integer and floating-point numeric types must also be made explicit:

.. testcode:: typeConversion

    (swift) let three = 3
    // three : Int = 3
    (swift) let pointOneFourOneFiveNine = 0.14159
    // pointOneFourOneFiveNine : Double = 0.14159
    (swift) let pi = Double(three) + pointOneFourOneFiveNine
    // pi : Float64 = 3.14159

Here, the value of the constant ``three`` is used to create a new ``Double``,
so that both sides of the addition are of the same type.
The addition would not be allowed without this conversion in place.

The rules for numeric named values are different from
the rules for numeric literal values seen earlier ‚Äì
where the literal value ``3`` was added to the literal value ``0.14159`` ‚Äì
because number literals do not have an explicit type in and of themselves.
Their type is only inferred at the point that they are evaluated by the compiler.

.. TODO: the return type of pi here is inferred as Float64,
   but it should really be inferred as Double.
   This is due to rdar://15211554.
   This code sample should be updated once the issue is fixed.

.. NOTE: this section on explicit conversions could be included in the Operators section.
   I think it's more appropriate here, however,
   and helps to reinforce the ‚Äòjust use Int‚Äô message.

Numeric Bounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimum and maximum values of each integer type can be accessed using its ``min`` and ``max`` properties:

.. testcode:: namedValues

    (swift) let minimumValue = UInt8.min
    // minimumValue : UInt8 = 0
    (swift) let maximumValue = UInt8.max
    // maximumValue : UInt8 = 255

The values of these properties are of the appropriate sized number type
(such as ``UInt8`` in the example above),
and can therefore be used in expressions alongside other values of the same type.

Booleans
--------

Swift has a basic :newTerm:`Boolean` type, called ``Bool``.
Booleans are a special kind of logical value,
which can only ever be ``true`` or ``false``:

.. testcode:: booleans

    (swift) let orangesAreOrange = true
    // orangesAreOrange : Bool = true
    (swift) let turnipsAreDelicious = false
    // turnipsAreDelicious : Bool = false

The types of ``orangesAreOrange`` and ``turnipsAreDelicious`` have been inferred
from the fact that they were initialized with ``Bool`` values.
As with ``Int`` and ``Double`` above,
you don't need to declare named values as being ``Bool``
if you set them to ``true`` or ``false`` as soon as you create them.
Type inference helps to make Swift code much more concise and readable
when initializing named values with known types of value.

Boolean values are particularly useful when working with conditional statements such as ``if else``:

.. testcode:: booleans

    (swift) if turnipsAreDelicious {
        println("Mmm, tasty turnips!")
    } else {
        println("Eww, turnips are horrible.")
    }
    >>> Eww, turnips are horrible.

Conditional statements such as ``if else`` are covered in more detail in :doc:`ControlFlow`.

Swift's type safety means that non-boolean values cannot be substituted for ``Bool``.
You cannot, for example, say::

    (swift) let i = 1
    // i : Int = 1
    (swift) if i {
        // do stuff
    }

‚Ä¶because ``i`` is not a ``Bool``.
However, it is valid to say::

    (swift) if i == 1 {
        // do stuff
    }
    
The result of the ``i == 1`` comparison is a ``Bool``,
and so this second example passes the type-check.
(Comparisons like ``i == 1`` are discussed in :doc:`Operators`.)

As with other examples of type safety in Swift,
this approach avoids accidental errors,
and ensures that the intention of a particular section of code is always made clear.

Tuples
------

:newTerm:`Tuples` are a way to group together multiple values of various types.
They provide a simple way to pass around multiple values as a single entity.

Here's an example of a tuple:

.. testcode:: tuples

    (swift) let statusCode = (404, "Not Found")
    // statusCode : (Int, String) = (404, "Not Found")

``(404, "Not Found")`` is a tuple that describes an *HTTP status code*.
An HTTP status code is a special value returned by a web server whenever you request a web page.
A status code of ``404 Not Found`` is returned if you request a web page that does not exist.

The ``(404, "Not Found")`` tuple groups together an ``Int`` and a ``String``
to give the HTTP status code two separate values:
a number, and a human-readable description.
It can be described as ‚Äúa tuple of type ``(Int, String)``‚Äù.

You can create tuples from whatever permutation of types you like,
and they can contain as many different types as you like.
There's nothing stopping you from having
a tuple of type ``(Int, Int, Int)``, or ``(String, Bool)``,
or indeed any other permutation you require.

You can access the individual element values in a tuple using index numbers starting at zero:

.. testcode:: tuples

    (swift) statusCode.0
    // r0 : Int = 404
    (swift) statusCode.1
    // r1 : String = "Not Found"

Tuples are particularly useful as the return values of functions.
A function that tries to retrieve a web page might return this ``(Int, String)`` tuple type
to describe the success or failure of the page retrieval.
By returning a tuple with two distinct values,
each of a different type,
the function is able to provide more useful information about its outcome
than if it could only return a single value of a single type.
Functions are described in detail in :doc:`Functions`.

Tuples are useful for temporary groups of related values.
They are not suited to the creation of complex data structures.
If your data structure would benefit from named member values,
or is likely to persist beyond a temporary scope,
it should be modeled as a :newTerm:`class` or :newTerm:`structure`,
rather than as a tuple.
Classes and structures are described in detail in :doc:`ClassesAndStructures`.

Optionals
---------

:newTerm:`Optionals` are a way to handle missing values.
They can be used to say:

* There *is* a value, and it equals *x*

‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶

* There *isn't* a value at all

This concept doesn't exist in C or Objective-C.
The nearest thing in Objective-C is
the ability to return ``nil`` from a method that would otherwise return an object,
with ``nil`` meaning ‚Äòthe absence of a valid object‚Äô.
However, this only works for objects ‚Äì it doesn't work for
structs, or basic C types, or enumeration values.
For these types,
Objective-C methods typically return a special value (such as ``NSNotFound``) to indicate the absence of a value.
This assumes that the method's caller knows there is a special value to test for,
and remembers to check for it.
Swift's optionals give a way to indicate the absence of a value for *any type at all*,
without the need for special constants or ``nil`` tests.

Here's an example.
Swift's ``String`` type has a function called ``toInt()``,
which trys to convert a ``String`` value into an ``Int`` value.
However, it is not possible to convert every possible string into an integer.
The string ``"123"`` can be converted into the numeric value ``123``,
but the string ``"hello, world"`` does not have an obvious numeric value to convert to.

The example below shows how to use ``toInt()`` to try and convert a ``String`` into an ``Int``:

.. testcode:: optionals

    (swift) let possibleNumber = "123"
    // possibleNumber : String = "123"
    (swift) let convertedNumber = possibleNumber.toInt()
    // convertedNumber : Int? = <unprintable value>

``convertedNumber`` has an inferred type of ``Int?``, not ``Int``.
The question mark indicates that the value it contains is an *optional* ``Int``,
meaning that it might contain *some* ``Int`` value,
or it might contain *no value at all*.
(It can't contain anything else, such as a ``Bool`` or a ``String`` ‚Äì
it's either an ``Int``, or it's nothing at all.)

You can use an ``if else`` statement to find out whether or not an optional contains a value.
If an optional does have a value, it equates to ``true``;
if it has no value at all, it equates to ``false``.

Once you are sure that the optional *does* contain a value,
you can access its underlying value
by adding an exclamation mark (``!``) to the end of the optional's name.
The exclamation mark effectively says
‚ÄúI know that this optional definitely has a value ‚Äì please use it‚Äù.

.. testcode:: optionals

    (swift) if convertedNumber {
        println(convertedNumber!)
    } else {
        println("The string could not be converted into an integer")
    }
    >>> 123

.. TODO: Add a section about arrays and dictionaries once their design is more tied down.
