.. docnote:: Control flow

	Some aspects of control flow will already have been introduced before this chapter as part of the language tour. I'm envisaging that the basic flow control introduced in that chapter will provide enough flexibility to get us through the chapters on types, operators, strings and generics, before going into much more detail on all the possibilities here.

.. docnote:: Subjects to be covered in this section

	* Conditional branching (if)
	* Looping (while, do while, for, for in)
	* Iterators
	* Switch statement (including pattern matching)
	* Pattern matching on classes?
	* Control transfer (return, break, continue, fallthrough)
	* Ranges
	* Clarity around half-closed (1..10) and closed (1...10) ranges
