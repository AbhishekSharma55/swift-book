Introduction

*The Swift Programming Language* is one of the documents weâ€™ll be publishing at WWDC. The chapters available here are a work in progress, and change fairly frequently (please see the `Change Log`_ for a list of recent changes).

Chapters that have not yet been written are indicated with an [x] after their name. These chapters will be added as soon as an initial draft is available.

Please send any comments on this book to the Developer Publications Swift Discuss list (`Developer Publications-swift-discuss@group.apple.com <mailto:Developer Publications-swift-discuss@group.apple.com?subject=The%20Swift%20Programming%20Language%20book>`_).
