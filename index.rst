Introduction
============

Developer Publications are creating a new book called *The Swift Programming Language*, to help with the adoption of Swift. A first edition of the complete book will be made available at WWDC 2014. Until then, it is a living document, and will be updated as the language evolves. The latest work-in-progress version is accessible from the chapter links below.

Please send any comments on this book to Dave Addey (`dave.addey@apple.com <mailto:dave.addey@apple.com?subject=The%20Swift%20Programming%20Language%20book>`_), Senior Writer, Developer Publications.
